I am an expert of software programming. Software,which I think is virtuality of the real world, can express almost all my interest in Society,Religion,Politics and Philosophy.

Since graduation from the Nanjing University as a Bachelor of Software Engineer in 2007,I have been working as a software engineer for years.

The fields I have been focus on include: vehicle navigation,3g wireless network and CNC. I`m proficient on C/C++ on Windows, lua,assembly on Windows,javascript,java on both Windows and Linux and some other techniques.
Use what I know to change what I see as I can,our chaos lab focus on make our life better with high quality software.we have worked out some projects on android: a game like Plants vs Zombie, call-taxi system,a share location application(still working on).
The software design and programming are almost the same between different languages and platforms, the former experience makes me a good android programmer(or I am trying to be).
If you have any requirement on your field or dreams or anything I can help, I would like very much to realize it. So, just contact me!
