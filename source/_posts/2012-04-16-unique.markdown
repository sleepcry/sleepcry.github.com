Will life stop if one isn't unque? Who'd like to admit one's self is just a normal part of the huge society monster? Unfortunately, that's the truth.   
So is products. I can't imagine there is a product which has exclusive features with all other product except monopoly.   
Therefore, there is nothing supprising to find that there is alreadly some similiar product  while bringing out something finally after so many hard work and expect.
Dont't even think to be unique, feel free to feel happy and satisfied because of usefulness to the publics.
